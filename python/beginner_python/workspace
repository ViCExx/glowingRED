msg = "Thank you very much, m\ty\tb\to\ty."
print(msg)

# the \t is tab
# the \n is a new line

#If you want to print \ you must put two
print("\\")

# we can use double quotes and single quotes
# just depends if you are needing to quote someone, etc.
# or pull out an operator like the example below.

msg = 'you\'re a star'
print(msg)

#

msg1 = "yooooo yo yooo"
msg2 = "hmu"
msg3 = "where you at?"

print(msg2 + "..." + msg3)

# if you are expecting 1 argument -> use concatenation

# this example shows where the concat can be done to make it more logical in, the message gets created, and then passed through the print function.

msg1 = "yooooo yo yooo"
msg2 = "hmu"
msg3 = "where you at?"
full_msg = (msg1 + "..." + msg3)
print(full_msg)

# makes it look cleaner, imo


#you can also prefix with r which will make a raw string (ignoring escapes except same quote)
print(r"as raw as I've ever seen. W O W") #only \' is escaped
#keep in mind the single quotes can't be with the single quote before, unless we escape it out. i prefer going to double to fit the single in, easier for me to read.
